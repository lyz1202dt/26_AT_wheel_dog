     * @brief The MujocoVisualization class provides a wrapper for visualizing MuJoCo simulations using GLFW and OpenGL.
     *
     * The class encapsulates the necessary data structures and functions to initialize, update, and terminate the visualization.
     * It provides methods for handling keyboard and mouse input, rendering the scene, and interacting with the visualization window.
     * The visualization is based on the MuJoCo model and data structures, allowing real-time rendering of the simulation state.
     *
     * To use this class, you need to call the init() method to initialize the visualization, followed by the update() method
     * in a loop to continuously update and render the visualization. Finally, call the terminate() method to clean up resources
     * and free memory when the visualization is no longer needed.
     *
     * The MujocoVisualization class follows the singleton design pattern, ensuring that only one instance of the visualization
     * is created and accessed through the getInstance() method. This allows convenient access to the visualization from anywhere
     * in the code without needing to pass around object references.
     *
     * Note: This class relies on GLFW and OpenGL, and assumes that the necessary dependencies are properly installed.
