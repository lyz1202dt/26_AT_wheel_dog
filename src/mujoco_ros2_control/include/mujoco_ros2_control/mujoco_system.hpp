     * @brief Implements the MujocoSystem interface for controlling a Mujoco robot model.
     *
     * The MujocoSystem class is an implementation of the MujocoSystemInterface, which serves as the interface between the
     * Mujoco physics engine and the ROS 2 control framework. It provides methods for initializing the Mujoco model,
     * updating the model state, and sending commands to the model.
     *
     * This class utilizes the Mujoco C library to interact with the Mujoco model. It provides functions for initializing
     * the model, setting the control inputs, and stepping the simulation forward in time. It also interfaces with the ROS 2
     * control framework by implementing the necessary interfaces and callbacks.
     *
     * The MujocoSystem class is responsible for reading the state of the Mujoco model, updating the controller outputs, and
     * writing the results back to the model. It acts as the bridge between the ROS 2 control system and the underlying
     * Mujoco simulation.
